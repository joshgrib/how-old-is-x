# how-old-is-x

Simple static site to save birthdays and see how old people are at a given time

Fixes the problem of trying to remember birthdays and calculate ages of friends/family

Should work fully offline once loaded, so it can be saved to the homescreen on a phone and used whenever in the future

Just a static HTML site, nothing special to see here...

UI is more optimized for mobile since that's the intended use case, desktop works but it's not as pretty
